Hi there! My name's Dominik Sta≈Ñczak-Marikin and I'm currently a Python
software developer.

I previously worked at a large pharma company with data processing pipelines for neurodegenerative disease research, at the [Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser
Microfusion](https://www.ifpilm.pl/en) in Warsaw, Poland as a research
software engineer, where I helped analyse data from [Wendelstein 7-X,
the currently (2023) largest stellarator in the
world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X), and at Samsung R&D Poland, helping with natural language translation. I consider myself
a recovering physicist.

In my spare time, I usually:

-   help out with open source software projects such as
    [PlasmaPy](http://plasmapy.org/) or [Beyond All Reason](https://www.beyondallreason.info/)
-   tinker, script and automate
-   worry a lot (but I'm getting better about it!)
-   crack jokes and smith puns
-   read books and learn lots
-   write simulations to better understand physical systems and stare at pretty data viz
-   play games - classic RTSes made me who I am now. *StarCraft II* was
    a huge part of my life, but nowadays I mostly play *Factorio* with
    my wife.
-   take care of our doggo, Igornacy
-   hike or bike in forests or mountains
-   write on [this here blog](/) to help people
    out and scratch the teaching itch. In fact, if you've found this blog at all useful or enjoyable, there's no better way to express that (and make my day, too!) than to tell me about it!
