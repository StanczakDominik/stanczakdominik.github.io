Hi there! My name's Dominik Sta≈Ñczak-Marikin and I'm currently a software
developer working with data processing pipelines for
neurodegenerative disease research at a large pharmaceutical company.

I previously worked at the [Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser
Microfusion](https://www.ifpilm.pl/en) in Warsaw, Poland as a research
software engineer, where I helped analyse data from [Wendelstein 7-X,
the currently (2023) largest stellarator in
the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X). I consider myself a recovering plasma physicist.

In my spare time, among other activities, I:

- help out with open source software projects such as [PlasmaPy](http://plasmapy.org/)
- tinker, script and automate
- read books and learn lots
- play games - classic RTSes made me who I am now. *StarCraft II* was a huge part of my life, but nowadays I mostly play *Factorio* with my wife and *Heroes of the Storm* to fulfill my competitive needs.
- take care of our dog <!--TODO this should be a link to gallery-->
- write on my blog (see [<i class="fa fa-pencil"></i>Posts](/posts) on the left) to scratch the teaching itch

<!-- # My tools of choice -->

<!-- - Python -->
<!-- - vim -->
<!-- - ArchLinux, btw -->
