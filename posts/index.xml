Past tense, because since September I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully found remote work as a Python software developer at a large pharmaceutical company. Speaking of&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can say as much as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped about the projects we&amp;rsquo;re working on, but, suffice to say, I think they have some real potential for helping people with neurodegenerative diseases. So I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to tackle one of the Large Problems, just&amp;hellip; another one, and more so from a backend/support angle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While writing this, I realized that this story was also deeply intertwined with the story of the global COVID-19 pandemic, because that turned the whole situation on its head. I thought about separating the two, but decided instead to embrace it and tell it whole rather than in pieces. So, beware, this is going to get &lt;em>long&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fusion 1/4: Nuclear power as of 2021</title><link>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2021/fusion1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2021/fusion1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Hi! In the new year, &lt;a href="./2021">as promised&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;ll see more actual science discussions on this page. I have - I think, for the first time since I started writing here - a plan for the next four posts. The first will discuss nuclear power and its place in the world. The second will tell you a little about its most interesting future alternative - fusion power. Next up, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss its history a little and where I predict it&amp;rsquo;ll head in the near future; and in the fourth, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to discuss a little about what we&amp;rsquo;re actually doing with it in terms of research work. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get to the fourth part, so that should be at least motivating. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anger, disinformation, populism, the sorry state of the world right now... and truth</title><link>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/anger-disinformation-populism-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/anger-disinformation-populism-truth/</guid><description>This post should be seen through the lens of self therapeutic writing, as I angrily work through a few ideas on my mind.
And now, for something completely different.
A colleague posted a link to a Breitbart story on Discord, and it got me thinking.
The story in question concerned Facebook, Twitter and Google allegedly censoring a viral video of doctors speaking out about alleged disinformation about COVID-19.
You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard all about that video by now - how the silly thing here is that the actual disinformation was&amp;hellip; that exact video.</description></item><item><title>Dealing with backlogs</title><link>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/backlogs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/backlogs/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>I have a backlog problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like probably many of you in 2020, I suffer from having too much interesting
content to read, watch, listen to or play through. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about
ways to tackle my gathering points, and I think I finally have something I&amp;rsquo;m
willing to share that could be useful for you as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First JOSS review!</title><link>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/first-joss-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/first-joss-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Several months ago, I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4eKWN_eAxM">the journal they call
Joss&lt;/a>. Well, actually, &lt;a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS - the
Journal of Open Source Software, &amp;ldquo;a developer friendly, open access journal for
research software packages&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a completely free,
open-source and open-access alternative to established,
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science">for-(often-a-lot-of)-profit&lt;/a>
journals such as those by Reed-Elsevier or Springer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a few days ago, &lt;a href="https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2133#issuecomment-618617823">I&amp;rsquo;ve been called into
service&lt;/a>
to review &lt;a href="https://github.com/joglekara/VlaPy">VlaPy, &amp;ldquo;1D-1V Vlasov-Poisson(-Fokker-Planck) Plasma Physics
Simulation Tool&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. While I&amp;rsquo;m digging into that code, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write something up about JOSS in general!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Post mortem for my engineering thesis code, PythonPIC</title><link>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2019/pythonpic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2019/pythonpic/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m giving a presentation on this less-than-glorious subject on Friday, so
I figured, hey, it might be a nice time to write a summary of what &lt;a href="https://github.com/StanczakDominik/PythonPIC">that old
repository on my GitHub page&lt;/a> is. In a single video:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rE4-X-jNoFw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Admittedly, this post is going to be rather personal - this messy little code
was basically my life for a few hundreds of hours.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
