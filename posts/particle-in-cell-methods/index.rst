I think it might finally be about time to do some plasma physics
discussion on this blog, stay true to the name and so on…

Basically the only actual “scientific” work I have actually done with
plasmas up until now is writing a PIC simulation, PIC standing for
Particle-in-Cell. I thought I would take this opportunity to explain in
my own words what the concept is - I think it’s a clever one.

There are many reasons why you might want to simulate a plasma.
Simulations are often way cheaper than making a tokamak and causing the
plasma to develop turbulence, or sending out a probe to watch check
solar flares for traces of magnetic reconnection. There’s also the case
of needing simulations to understand and explain your experimental
results. For now, however, let’s just assume you have a burning desire
to make a few pretty plots and animations `like
these <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj9mwAww3TM>`__ using data that
you don’t have simple access to via experiment.

Plasma simulation in general
============================

Plasmas are, in general, difficult to simulate. Many of the interesting
processes in plasmas that you would like to simulate occur far from
equilibrium, both spatial and thermal. For example, you’d like to
simulate interactions between a plasma and a laser pulse (this is, in
fact, `what I did for my engineering
thesis <https://github.com/StanczakDominik/PythonPIC>`__). This is a
massively non-equilibrium process. This mostly rules out fluid
simulations such as two-fluid and magnetohydrodynamics, which are based
on averaging the `Vlasov
equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlasov_equation>`__ over all
possible velocities. You could, in theory, use the Vlasov equation
directly - but that’s a pretty darn high dimensional problem to be
solving a PDE on (though something I most certainly want to try my hand
at, one of these days!).

Suppose you want to take another approach. Maybe you like your
Newtonian, old fashioned dynamical particle trajectory ODEs, you’ve
dabbled in some N-body simulations, maybe you’ve done a bit of molecular
dynamics. You could imagine putting a bunch of charged particles into a
simulation, calculating forces between those directly and letting them
evolve over time.

Unfortunately, there is a major flaw in that plan. You’ve got long range
(Coulomb) :math:`r^{-2}` interactions between huge numbers of particles,
so you cannot use the neat trick common in molecular dynamics of only
including a few neighbor particles in your simulation. This means your
simulation will scale as full :math:`O(N^2)` in the number of particles
if you do that `(though there have been attempts at doing that
recently) <https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.033307>`__.
I guess you could also try `a Barnes-Hut treecode of some sort, and that
also appears to have been
done <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010465594902275>`__
- that doesn’t seem like it’s caught on, though, whatever the reason.

We’ve now set the stage and can move on to the main attraction…

The particle in cell method
===========================

The logic for a PIC is as follows, starting from the simple molecular
dynamics or N-body framework:

1. If we were to know the force on each particle for every time step, we
   could **push** them - update their velocities and positions as usual,
   in :math:`O(N)` steps. Each particle is assumed independent of
   others.
2. It’s hard to calculate the forces directly in :math:`O(N^2)` steps.
   On the other hand, It’s relatively easier to solve a PDE for the
   electromagnetic field given a charge and current distribution. The
   particles we’re moving are charged, so we can do the following
   translation:

   -  Particle positions :math:`\implies` charge distribution
   -  Particle positions and velocities :math:`\implies` current
      distribution

   This means we could **deposit** the particles onto a grid or mesh by
   some kind of interpolation. We can also set the grid size so that
   many particles go into a single grid cell: this implies that the
   number of grid cells is much lower than our particle count. That, in
   turn, fits our assumptions for plasmas [1]_. A picture is worth a
   thousand words, so here’s a very basic example of a particle’s charge
   with a linear (triangular, and thus, centered on the middle)
   distribution being split between three cells.

3. Once we have the charge and current distribution on our grid, we can
   use those quantities to **solve** Maxwell’s equations for the
   electromagnetic field. You could, for example, use a spectral method
   or a relaxation algorithm, like conjugate gradients.

4. Once we know the fields at the grid cell locations, we can **gather**
   the field from those to the particle locations. Remember step 1,
   where we wished for forces - readily available given fields - at
   particle locations? Well, here we go, wish granted!

5. ``goto 1``

And that’s it, the particle-in-cell method in a nutshell. Of course,
logically it makes more sense to start from 2. (as you would usually
start your simulation with a set of initial conditions for the particle
positions, velocities and maybe external fields), but to me it’s cleaner
narratively to think of the algorithm in this order.

The advantages
--------------

1. It’s close to fundamental physics and thus understandable! You get a
   full picture of what each of the particles does, how the fields
   behave, while making very few assumptions.
2. It’s lightning fast! The :math:`O(N^2)` force calculation is reduced
   to the complexity of your three replacement steps. While you can
   expect deposition and gathering to be roughly :math:`O(Nm)`
   (:math:`m` being the number of cells), :math:`N` is much larger than
   :math:`m`, and the field solver is going to scale independently of
   :math:`N` - so that’s still a massive gain over direct summation.
3. It’s easy to parallelize! Each particle is essentially independent
   for the pushing step (as they only interact with each other via
   fields), so those movements are trivially parallel. Grid operations
   can also be done in parallel (though admittedly I haven’t looked into
   that much, yet - I fully intend to do so).

And of course, no description of a simulation method is complete
without…

The disadvantages
-----------------

1. The method is mostly explicit, so that limits your time step and grid
   size quite a lot. Otherwise, you get spurious instabilities.
2. Statistical noise makes life a pain when you’re working on PIC
   simulations, precisely because you’re modeling your large numbers of
   real particles with fewer virtual discrete ones. The trick seems to
   be increasing the particle numbers, but `Wikipedia
   claims <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell#Technical_aspects>`__
   that this source of error is more figured out for traditional grid
   methods. In a way, this also means PICs are a prime target for GPUs,
   as exhibited by
   `PIConGPU <https://picongpu.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.3/index.html>`__.

Still, PICs are used in many awesome applications, such as plasma
turbulence research, and their parallelizability means they’re only
going to get more important in the coming exascale computing era.

I’ll be writing a few follow-up posts going over particular aspects of
PIC codes - tricks I’ve picked up along the way, etc. Stay tuned!
