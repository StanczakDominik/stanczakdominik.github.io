I thought I'd give a quick update on some recent happenings.

---

Firstly, and most importantly, and I'm still a little shocked that this actually happened - we got married! :)

With that, and since there's nothing more beautiful in life than symmetry, we've decided to both take a combo surname. Thus, the [About page](/about) has had a minor text update :)

Secondly ― and I'm also in shock about this ― it's happened twice recently that folks (Readers, I should call them!) wrote to me that they liked this very blog and found what I write here helpful.

I'd like to take this opportunity to say: if you like what I write here, giving me a heads up about that is the best way to ensure more gets written here! Shout-out to Diogo, who demonstrated that principle today :)

In [*"Update on the year 2019"*](/posts/update-on-the-year-2019), I wrote:

> At the start of December, I started a research software job at the Institute for Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion here in Warsaw, Poland! This is also where I'll be writing and developing my master's thesis, related to Bayesian inference for plasma diagnostics on Wendelstein 7-x, using Python and more specifically PyMC3. A step forwards for modern, open, reproducible and maintainable science software! At least, I hope so. :)

and it's nice to see how hopeful I was in 2019, right before the pandemic year hit! I'll sum up what I learned at IPPLM in [my next post](/posts/ifpilm-postmortem), but for now I have to say that with the end of August 2022, I've decided to quit the Institute and return to software development. The key factor in that decision was... remote work, or rather, lack thereof.

I still intend to support the fusion project, but I intend to do so on my own time, the way I do best - by creating, improving upon and generally helping out with openly available tools in that ecosystem.

I'm still finalizing my new job, so I don't want to say much just yet, but expect the next posts to introduce the projects happening there.

All right, that should wrap things up for now. Expect to see another update sooner than later :)
