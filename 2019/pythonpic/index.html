In a single video:</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rE4-X-jNoFw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Admittedly, this post is going to be rather personal - this messy little code

<a class=heading-link href=#the-motivation><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>At the time, I was quite enamored with Python, NumPy, the ideals of <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886731/>open
source scientific software</a> and literate computing. I had seen
how most scientific software seems to be written in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran>uglier</a>,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>less maintainable</a> languages and thoroughly disliked the notion that
We, the Scientific Community would have to keep struggling with those, <a href="https://youtu.be/kNdp0I8AG40?t=45"><em>no no
no</em></a>.</p><p>So I figured, hey, I can probably do better. <em>I know NumPY! It&rsquo;s basically
writing FORTRAN without ever touching FORTRAN!</em></p><blockquote><p><em>narrator voice: <strong>It isn&rsquo;t.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>So I went to the amazing Sławomir Jabłoński of <a href=http://www.ifpilm.pl/en>IPPLM</a> (to whom,
a shout out, for he is truly an amazing person without whom this work would
have gone nowhere). I discussed the idea with him and he seemed to like it. He
agreed to supervise me on this idea.</p><p>What happened next?</p><h2 id=the-breakdown>The breakdown
<a class=heading-link href=#the-breakdown><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Well, stuff happened, not least important of which was procrastination on
a scale I had never performed. One of my personal flaws is a tendency to
isolate myself and work alone on projects that are better undertaken in groups.
I basically started writing a framework, refactoring it endlessly, delaying
work on the critical bugs like the actual physics of my simulation, running
test cases&mldr; What I had thought would have been simple turned out not to be.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I learned a metric ton of Python and numerics knowledge</p><ul><li>but I wasn&rsquo;t getting much closer, and I wasn&rsquo;t reaching out for feedback that
what I was doing was, pretty much, crap.</li></ul><p>I <em>may</em> have had a tiny nervous
breakdown then. Eventually I reached out again to IPPLM and mr. Jabłoński, who
agreed the situation is pretty bad but didn&rsquo;t think it worth giving up on. The
code ended up working after many adventures:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>

<a class=heading-link href=#the-benchmarking><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I then - only then, certainly a failure of foresight on my part - realized that
I would need a comparable C/C++ code to benchmark my Python NumPy monstrosity
against. That was not a happy thought.</p><p>But there was no way the low level drudgery could be avoided, so I went ahead,
started learning <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">the Eigen3 linear algebra library that has many similarities
to NumPy</a> - I needed something that in principle could work
similarly, with mostly whole array based computations. The result of that is in
<a href=https://github.com/StanczakDominik/CPIC>this repository</a>.</p><p>Admittedly, to this day I&rsquo;m not even one hundred percent sure it does the same
thing! The results seemed to be correct for the test cases I did run, but I&rsquo;m
not exactly sure I got all of the bugs. Most of the problems stem from the fact
I used <code>numpy.bincount</code> for most of the current and charge deposition
functionality (don&rsquo;t do that, by the way, as that was the least efficient part
of the code). That functionality is lacking in Eigen (or at the very least
I was unable to find it), so I went ahead and implemented it by hand.</p><p>I then started benchmarking the two codes for identical initial conditions, and
it turned out that -</p><p><img src=/images/speed_Python_C.svg alt="Python vs C"></p><p>success! PythonPIC is just as fast as the compiled C version!</p><p>&mldr; until you compile the C code with <code>-O</code>, the simplest optimization flag:</p><p><img src=/images/speed_Python_C_C-O.svg alt="Python vs any kind of optimized C"></p><p>I didn&rsquo;t bother checking <code>-O3</code>, though a friend was happy to remind me of its
existence. I might thus be the proud
author of the cleanest (well, not the least clean) and least efficient
particle-in-cell code on the planet. Gotta start somewhere, right?</p><h2 id=the-defense>The defense
<a class=heading-link href=#the-defense><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>There&rsquo;s not much to say. I went ahead, printed out a few copies of the thesis,
realized via review I had made mistakes in plots etc. and had to print them out
again. I went ahead, took my final exam, didn&rsquo;t get grilled too hard, got
a random exam question about - I think, as it&rsquo;s been a while - the Schroedinger
equation, and poof, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8hvyjZWHs">trust me, I&rsquo;m an
engineer</a> of Applied
Physics. I&rsquo;m still not sure how that happened.</p><p>I took a break from PIC codes for a while afterwards. A snippet of PythonPIC
later went into <a href=https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/54>PlasmaPy&rsquo;s</a>
particle stepper capabilities. I still have a thorough dislike for that code
and think it could be optimized.</p><p>All in all, I&rsquo;m not sure about Python for PICs. On the one hand, they&rsquo;re pretty
inevitably going to be slower than C, C++ for now. You could write the
computationally intensive parts in Julia or something - that would probably
work and I&rsquo;ve been itching to try my hand at that recently - but by that logic,
you could probably implement the whole thing in Julia anyway, because Python
really isn&rsquo;t giving you anything of value there - maybe besides analysis, but
that&rsquo;s done post-run anyway.</p><p>But on the other hand, not all PICs are HPiCs - and if you&rsquo;re just studying
plasma physics alongside, say, <a href=https://www.crcpress.com/Plasma-Physics-via-Computer-Simulation/Birdsall-Langdon/p/book/9780750310253>Birdsall and
Langdon</a>,
then you can probably live with having your code run a little slower than the
sickest optimal C run time. I&rsquo;ve been able to use my code (mostly before the
break&mldr; remember the part where I was adding a ton of test cases?) to
reproduce a bunch of their results and it&rsquo;s worked out nicely.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to think PythonPIC has, thus, at least some value and use. It&rsquo;s probably
not too useful for high performance and research, but you need to funnel people into those
somehow.</p><h1 id=the-lessons-learned>The lessons learned
