And good riddance to 2020!

# How things went

Well, [13 posts throughout the year](https://stanczakdominik.github.io/2020/) ain't too bad! I did fall off hard in the latter part of the year, as things went sour in multiple ways.

Let's see... I had to rapidly switch up my master's thesis topic, due to infeasibility of the previous idea; someone close to me got diagnosed with depression and I landed a support role; and on top of that, [*our* government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx7zI1W_5JI) decided that *hey, it's going to be a wonderful idea to take the opportunity and hit women in their reproductive rights while people are stuck at home, nobody's going to come out and protest, right?*

Well... 
[that didn't work out for them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October%E2%80%93December_2020_Polish_protests).

So, as it turned out, 2020 also ended up being the year I got tear gassed and chased by fascists for the first time. Who knew.

We attended a bunch of those protests - we were able to self-isolate pretty tightly through most of the pandemic, and neither me nor my partner are in a particularly risky group; and we felt that enough was enough. There's a lot of misinformation going on about Antifa on the internets; turns out they're wonderful as a marching band.

I should share some pictures on here... I'll do that as soon as I figure out how to.

But hey, for the first time ever I got signs that people actually read and enjoy some of this, which is nice! ;)

And there were plenty of bright moments in all this gloom and darkness; I gave my first conference talk [(on PlasmaPy!)](http://plasmapy.org/), started limiting and quitting social media, got - I think - better at reading in an organized way, started reconnecting and reaching out to people while dog walking... I can't say 2020 hit me particularly hard, personally. I survived; not everyone was so lucky.

# Plans for 2021

A while ago, this blog was named "Plasma non-stop". [Hey, I was going through a Hamilton phase, don't judge.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbdQAeO0vo) I later changed that name, deciding that *hey, I write here mostly about programming; there's little plasma/fusion content and I feel kind of bad about overpromising with the name*.

Well, that's changing. I've been explaining nuclear/fusion/plasma to enough people recently that I feel like it's going to be worth it to write all that down. Have an up-to-date reference I can link to in discussions, so to speak. And besides that... I do love popularising science, and have [Thoughts](/posts/anger-disinformation-populism-truth/) on why that's an important thing to be doing.

I would also like to make my notes public, once again; I used to use vimwiki, which made that easy, but now, with [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), I don't yet know how to do it nicely. Once I do figure it out, they'll be accessible from here.

The blog will be going through a visual redesign; I think I'm going to get off Disqus and go with something more opensource/privacy-minded.

Last but definitely not least, I do have a master's thesis to write, and I expect I'll be able to more reliably keep you all updated on that. More on that soon.

And for now... have a better new year! :)
