In alphabetic order, as I would rather not judge their relative importances. If
the order is unalphabetic or if you think I have forgotten someone, 
[PRs are welcome](https://github.com/StanczakDominik/stanczakdominik.github.io) and angry IMs are as well, if you're into that kind of thing.

* Kabat "Piotr" Kabaci≈Ñski, my partner in physics crime and StarCraft misdemeanor from the first years of university. Living proof that reaching out to people with interesting profile pictures *("oh, isn't that Tassadar?")* is the best investment you can make in life.
* Karolina Czerniak, who's my personal definition of a scientific success story and a constant source of cheer in my life.
* Monika Seniut, who worked with me despite my quirks and always pushed me to *improve further and further*. Some say she's still out there, continuing to *improve further and further* to this day.
* Paulina Marikin, my wonderful girlfriend, who's always amazingly supportive, frankly amazing and will always provide you with an interesting fact about graph theory.
* [PlasmaPy Community](https://www.plasmapy.org), The: for many a PR collaborated on and many a glorious pun made. I learned a lot from them.
* Pythonistas, the people behind the entire open source and scientific computing ecosystem who give us all jobs - and not just those behind Python, of course!
* Richard Feynman, who needs no introduction and whose books basically got me into physics.

... and many others that I'm sure I missed - my sincerest apologies!
