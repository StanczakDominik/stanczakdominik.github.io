Past tense, because since September I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully found remote work as a Python software developer at a large pharmaceutical company. Speaking of&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can say as much as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped about the projects we&amp;rsquo;re working on, but, suffice to say, I think they have some real potential for helping people with neurodegenerative diseases. So I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to tackle one of the Large Problems, just&amp;hellip; another one, and more so from a backend/support angle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While writing this, I realized that this story was also deeply intertwined with the story of the global COVID-19 pandemic, because that turned the whole situation on its head. I thought about separating the two, but decided instead to embrace it and tell it whole rather than in pieces. So, beware, this is going to get &lt;em>long&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
