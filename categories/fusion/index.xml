Past tense, because since September I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully found remote work as a Python software developer at a large pharmaceutical company. Speaking of&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can say as much as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped about the projects we&amp;rsquo;re working on, but, suffice to say, I think they have some real potential for helping people with neurodegenerative diseases. So I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to tackle one of the Large Problems, just&amp;hellip; another one, and more so from a backend/support angle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While writing this, I realized that this story was also deeply intertwined with the story of the global COVID-19 pandemic, because that turned the whole situation on its head. I thought about separating the two, but decided instead to embrace it and tell it whole rather than in pieces. So, beware, this is going to get &lt;em>long&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fusion 1/4: Nuclear power as of 2021</title><link>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/posts/2021/fusion1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stanczakdominik.github.io/posts/2021/fusion1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Hi! In the new year, &lt;a href="./2021">as promised&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;ll see more actual science discussions on this page. I have - I think, for the first time since I started writing here - a plan for the next four posts. The first will discuss nuclear power and its place in the world. The second will tell you a little about its most interesting future alternative - fusion power. Next up, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss its history a little and where I predict it&amp;rsquo;ll head in the near future; and in the fourth, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to discuss a little about what we&amp;rsquo;re actually doing with it in terms of research work. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get to the fourth part, so that should be at least motivating. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
