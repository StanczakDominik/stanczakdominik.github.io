Hi there! My name's Dominik Sta≈Ñczak and I'm currently a research software
engineer at the [Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser
Microfusion](https://www.ifpilm.pl/en) in Warsaw, Poland, where I help write
code for diagnostics of [Wendelstein 7-X, the currently (2020) largest stellarator in
the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X).

In my spare time, among other activities, I fight procrastination, study the art of
muffin-making, help out with open source projects such as
[PlasmaPy](http://plasmapy.org/), read books or write short technical notes on
interesting solutions to problems in simulations or data analysis.

# Where to find me

On [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@StanczakDominik:matrix.org), I'm
[`@StanczakDominik:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/@StanczakDominik:matrix.org).
This is probably the fastest way to reach me via text chat.

You can always email me; take this blog's domain name (my surname + first name)
and stick `@gmail` onto it, and it should reach me :)

I do most of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/StanczakDominik).

I've recently quit Facebook and Twitter. Leaving both is highly recommended!
