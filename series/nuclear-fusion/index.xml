In the new year, &lt;a href="./2021">as promised&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;ll see more actual science discussions on this page. I have - I think, for the first time since I started writing here - a plan for the next four posts. The first will discuss nuclear power and its place in the world. The second will tell you a little about its most interesting future alternative - fusion power. Next up, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss its history a little and where I predict it&amp;rsquo;ll head in the near future; and in the fourth, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to discuss a little about what we&amp;rsquo;re actually doing with it in terms of research work. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get to the fourth part, so that should be at least motivating. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
